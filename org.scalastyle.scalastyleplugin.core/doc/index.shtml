        <h2>-- Introduction --</h2>
        <p> The Scalastyle plugin for Eclipse integrates the source code analyzer Scalastyle with Eclipse.<br/>
            <a href="https://github.com/scalastyle/scalastyle">Scalastyle</a> is a development tool
            written by Matthew Farwell to help you ensure that your Scala code adheres to a set of coding
            standards. Scalastyle does this by inspecting your Scala source code and pointing out
            items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Scalastyle distribution
            is included with the Scalastyle plugin.</p>
        <p>With the Scalastyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems.
            Within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View
            and source code annotations just as you would see with compiler errors or warnings.</p>
